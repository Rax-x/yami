# Yet another math interpreter

I started this interpreter to learn the 
[*Pratt Parser*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser) 
and _Vim_ shortcuts (yes, I know how to exit vim).
This interpreter is written entirely with pure Vim (no LSPs or anything) and in *C++11* (a real pain).
